# Checkpoint 5
- Your input is this:
    **let luckyNumbers = [7, 4, 38, 21, 16, 15, 12, 33, 31, 49]**
- Your job is to:
    - Filter out any numbers that are even
    - Sort the array in ascending order
    - Map the strings in the format "7 is a lucky number"
    - Print the resulting array, one item per line

## NOTES:
- You need to use the **filter()**, **sorted()**, and **map()** functions.
- The order in which you run the functions matters.
- To chain these functions, use **luckyNumbers.first{}.second{}**, obviously putting the real function calls in there.
- You should use **isMultiple(of: )** to remove even numbers.
