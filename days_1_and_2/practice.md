# Checkpoint 1
- Create a constant holding any temperature in Celsius.
- Convert that temperature to Fahrenheit by multiplying by 9, dividing by 5, then adding 32.
- Print the result, showing both the Celsius and Fahrenheit values.

NOTES:
- Use **let** to make your constant.
- Celsius is commonly stored as a decimal, so create it as one.
- We use * for multiplication and **/** for division.
- Use \(someVariable) to activate string interpolation
