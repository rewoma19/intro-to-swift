# Summary: Conditions and loops
- We can use **if**, **else**, and **else if** statements to check conditions.
- You can combine using **||** and **&&**.
- **switch** statements can be easier than using **if** and **else if** a lot, and Swift will check that they are **exhaustive**.
- The ternary conditional operator lets us check **WTF**: **What?**, **True**, **False**.
- **for** loops let us loop over arrays, sets, dictionaries, and ranges.
- **while** loops create loops that continue running until a condition is false.
- We can skip loop items using **continue** or **break** respectively.
