# Checkpoint 2
- Create an array of strings, then write some code that prints the number of items in the array, and also the number of unique items in the array.

NOTES:
- You should start by creating an array of strings, using something like this:
**let albums = ["Red", "Fearless"]**
- You can read the number of items in your array using **albums.count**.
- **count** also exists for sets.
- Sets can be made from arrays using **Set(someArray)**.
- Sets never include duplicates.
