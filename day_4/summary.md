# Summary: Complex data
- Arrays store many values, and read them using indices.
- Dictionaries also store many values, and read them using keys we specify.
- Sets store many values, but we do not choose their order.
- Enums create our own types to specify a range of acceptable values.
- Swift uses type inference to figure what data we are storing.
- It is also possible to use type annotation to force a particular type.
